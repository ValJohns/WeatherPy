During this assignment we were requested to complete a series of via API calling. 
The first task was to perform an API to OpenWeatherMap and retirieve the following: 
- Latitude and longitude
- Maximum temperature
- Percent humidity
- Percent cloudiness
- Wind speed
- Weather description (for example, clouds, fog, light rain, clear sky)

Once retrieve we needed to place in a dataframe and export as a cvs to convert it as the foundation to produce a vacation search. 
We were able to use the CVS and set to proper parameters to make a search for hotels using the ideal tempeture range in this case was 75-90 degrees. 
When the qualifying hotels were obtained I produced a layered map with pop-up markers that carried all the pertinent information for each qualifying location.
